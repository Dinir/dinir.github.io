  <h2>Video Game Music Composer and Web Developer</h2>

  <h3>About me</h3>
  <p>
    I’m a developer who enjoys composing music as a hobby and focuses on building tools and features that genuinely help users. I started programming as a hobby through HTML and gradually expanded into web development as I created projects for myself and other hobbyists.
  </p>

  <h3>What I Do</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Build tools and utilities using <b>Unity/C#</b> and vanilla <b>JavaScript</b>
    </li>
    <li>
      Create interactive, real-time web features and visualizers
    </li>
    <li>
      Design modular UI logic and functionality for gameplay-related tools
    </li>
    <li>
      Develop and maintain <b>LAMP-based</b> systems
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Notable Projects</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4>Streamliner (Unity/C#)</h4>
      <p>
        Learned Unity/C# from scratch to make a Class Library that replaces HUD for a video game called BallisticNG.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Mini Padder (JS/HTML5)</h4>
      <p>
        A lightweight real-time gamepad visualizer used by tens of thousands of users in the OBS community.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Creative Background</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Compose FM-synth and retro-inspired VGM tracks</li>
    <li>Create simple 16-bit SFX</li>
    <li>Edit video and visual assets for hobby projects</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>What Motivates Me</h3>
  <p>
    I find the most fulfillment when I can solve a problem, design a useful tool, and see it help real users. I enjoy learning new technologies and approaching development with curiosity and precision.
