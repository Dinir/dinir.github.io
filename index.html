  <h2>Video Game Music Composer and Web Developer</h2>

  <p>
    I enjoy composing music as a hobby and focus on building tools and features that genuinely help users. I started programming as a hobby through HTML and gradually expanded into web development as I created projects for myself and other hobbyists.

  <h3>What I Do</h3>

    <li>
      Build tools and utilities using vanilla <b>JavaScript</b> or <b>Unity/C#</b>
    </li>

    <li>
      Create interactive, real-time web features and visualizers
    </li>
    <li>
      Design modular UI logic and functionality for gameplay-related tools
    </li>
    </ul>
    <li>
      Develop and maintain <b>LAMP-based</b> systems
