## Video Game Music Composer and Web Developer

I enjoy composing music as a hobby and focus on building tools and features that genuinely help users. I started programming as a hobby through HTML and gradually expanded into web development as I created projects for myself and other hobbyists.

### What I Do
- Build tools and utilities using vanilla **JavaScript** or **Unity/C#**
  - Create interactive, real-time web features and visualizers
  - Design modular UI logic and functionality for gameplay-related tools
- Develop and maintain <b>LAMP-based</b> systems

### Notable Projects
- #### <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/ballisticng/mods/16" target="_blank">Streamliner (Unity/C#)</a>
  Learned Unity/C# from scratch to make a Class Library that replaces HUD for a video game called BallisticNG.
- #### <a href="https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/mini-padder.944/" target="_blank">Mini Padder (JS/HTML5)</a>
  A lightweight real-time gamepad visualizer used by tens of thousands of users in the OBS community.

### Creative Background
- Compose retro-inspired VGM tracks
- Create simple 16-bit SFX
- Edit video and visual assets for hobby projects
